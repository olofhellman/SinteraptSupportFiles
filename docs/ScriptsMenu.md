## Scripts Menu

The scripts menu is the place to put scripts that you use often.

Select the "Open Scripts Folder" menu item to open the scripts menu folder in the Finder.  Scripts which are placed in this folder will be available from the menu when you next launch the application.

It works hierarchically as well - Users can organize their scripts in different folders under the scripts menu.

Scripts that are run from the scripts menu have a performance advantage.  Because the communication happens within the "Sinterapt" applications, and not between two different applications, the time involved in processing the command is lower.
