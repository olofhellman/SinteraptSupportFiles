# SinteraptSupportFiles


This repo is for freely available support files for Sinterapt, the Atom Probe Tomography data analysis app.

Sinterapt gets its name because it is an app with a Scripting INTERface for analysis of APT data.  There's some familiar UI as well, but much of the value of the app lives in its scriptability.

The contents of this repo are some sample data files in the data directory, and some sample scripts in the scripts directory. And some introductory documentation on how to use Sinterapt.

Here's a tour of some of the features of the app:  If you are new to the app, it is strongly recommended to start by going in order through the first three links, "Opening a File", "Using the Scripting Interface", and "Defining Mass Ranges".
